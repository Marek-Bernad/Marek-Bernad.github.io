#### I have new hobby. Few years ago I started with smithing. For the first time I was helping my graandfather with creating of iron and steel nails. Few months later I was working on some special steel tools that my grandfather needed for transfering heavy objects, but still nothing special. Later I've started to smith my first knifes then daggers and finally, mu first sword. This year in a summer I am planning to smith one special sword on my anvil.
