##### I like to code. Even when I stand before some hard problem I love to solve it even if it is sometimes overkill, that could be my disadvantage. During my learning in school or my personal learning I've learned several programming languages or worked with other software:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PhP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL, Redis, C, C++, Java, Cach√© ObjectScript, Python, XML, UML, Pascal, Ruby, Markdown, Jekyll, DeepSee, JSON, IBM Process Designer, Enterprise Architect
{% endhighlight %}
