#### I was born in {{ site.author_birthday | escape }} in town called Bratislava, the capital city of Slovak Republic state. I have three brothers and perfect family that I actually live with.

#### I am a young programmer, student in Faculty of Informatic and Information Technologies in Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava. I am young developer and actually I will be working on first grant project in the history of Slovak and Czech Republic for company InterSystems. This project is about creating Redis API on the site of Caché services programmed with Caché object script with some good rest API. :sunglasses:
