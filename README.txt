Other Description:

I was working on project many hours to learn how to correctly use jekyll static
generator and made this web page in english language. I had a lot
of problems around setting up youtube API with GithubPages where coffee.js did not
help me afterall and I had to choose another plugin "Emoji". But I still let there
all prepared for youtube plugin where user only has to add one line in tab4.md
at the bottom for youtube link which should work for generating this folder with
jekyll locally on a localhost. After that on localhost user should see result in
tab "Programming Skills". This is the line to insert: {% youtube ntj1J5mSZxI %}
